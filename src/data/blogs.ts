# The Ultimate Guide to Cooking Perfect Pork Ribs

Pork ribs are a BBQ favorite that can elevate any meal from ordinary to extraordinary. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced cook, this comprehensive guide will help you master the art of cooking perfect pork ribs.

## Choosing the Right Cut

### Baby Back Ribs
Baby back ribs are cut from the top of the rib cage, along the spine. They're leaner, more tender, and cook faster than spare ribs.

**Best for:** Quick cooking, beginners
**Cooking time:** 3-4 hours
**Price range:** ₹660-800 per kg

### Spare Ribs
Spare ribs come from the belly side and are larger, meatier, and more flavorful than baby backs.

**Best for:** Long, slow cooking
**Cooking time:** 5-6 hours
**Price range:** ₹659-720 per kg

## The Perfect Seasoning

### Dry Rub Recipe
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

## Cooking Methods

### 1. Low and Slow Smoking (Recommended)
- Temperature: 225°F (107°C)
- Time: 5-6 hours for spare ribs, 3-4 hours for baby backs
- Internal temperature: 195-203°F (90-95°C)

### 2. Oven Method
- Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C)
- Wrap ribs in foil after 2 hours
- Total cooking time: 4-5 hours

### 3. Pressure Cooker Method
- High pressure for 25-30 minutes
- Natural release for 15 minutes
- Finish under broiler for caramelization

## Pro Tips for Perfect Ribs

1. **Remove the membrane:** Always remove the silver skin from the back of the ribs
2. **Season ahead:** Apply dry rub 2-24 hours before cooking
3. **Use the bend test:** Ribs are done when they crack slightly when bent
4. **Rest before serving:** Let ribs rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Cooking at too high temperature
- Not removing the membrane
- Oversaucing too early
- Not letting the meat rest
